    # Merging Two Packages

    Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item
    weights, implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` that finds
    two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`. Your
    function will return a tuple of integers that has the following form:

    ```
    (zero, one)
    ```

    where each element represents the item weights of the two packages.
    _**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and
    the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_ If such a
    pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return
    `None`.
